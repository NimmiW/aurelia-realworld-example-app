99xT Assignment - Account Balance Viewer

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Aurelia** including CRUD operations.




# How it works

Created with aurelia-cli

# Getting started

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Then run 
```
yarn install
au run --watch
```
and Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`. 

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `au build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `scripts/` directory. Use the `--env prod` flag for a production build.

## Functionality overview

Account balances are updated every month in the Jondell Corp and the CFO Dr. Sundt likes to
have a close look at the overview. Since Dr. Sundt has no experience in software development,
he would like to hire you to do his dirty laundry. So your job is to create a simple web enabled
account balance overview tool. There are 5 accounts in Jondell Corp and they are
- R&D
- Canteen
- CEOâ€™s car expenses
- Marketing
- Parking fines



**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
    - List of th balances of this month

- updatebalance oage
    - The Balances of this month could be updated

- reports page
    - report could be generated given the month and the year
